**The "Noble Nectars"** project is a landing-page dedicated to the world of wines.

The site is fully adaptive and designed taking into account semantic layout. A special feature of the project is the use of the **GSAP** library to create animations, which adds dynamics and uniqueness to the user experience. The **Swiper** library was chosen for the slider, thanks to which a convenient and smooth viewing of product images is realized.

**Stack**: HTML/CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Gulp, Swiper, GSAP
